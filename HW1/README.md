The following files hole my submissions for the HW 1 in CSCI 104.

The hw1.txt file holds the answeres to the problems 1 and 2 in the howm work assinment.

The perm.cpp program is the program that finds all the possible combinations of the a groups of letter could be mixed together in.To use this program please add the desired group of leters on the comand line after the inisialining the program. 

the hw1_list.cpp program is the program that takes a linklist from atext file. That Link list is later fused togther into a singel link list and then later has its even numbers removed. lastly there is another function that finds the adverage of the link list. To use this program place add the names of the text files holding the information for the linklist after inisializing the program. Following that text file add the name of antoher text file behing the first text file. this one will house the responces of the program.

In this program i have only managed to take the numbers out of the the text file. I would like to use a grace day on this program. I have yet to get the linklist inisalized of the programs following it. i would liek one more day to work on this project before being graded.
